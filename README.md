# webCharts - Spider Web Charts / Polar Grids Maker

Creates a Polar (concentric) Grid style chart based on a simple array of categories and elements.

## The Good

* Works for 3-6 category 'slices' and 3-6 'level' circles, with labels on the outside

* Has different colours for each 'slice' and different shades for each 'segment'

* Allows for smaller text and a thicker circle near the centre

* Has a scale variable to increase / decrease the size of the chart

## The Bad

* It has irrelevant level names - which should be read as labels, but are not (due to being used differently in an earlier version)

* The thicker central circle (while optional - just set width to 1 or comment out) could be dynamic if needed

* The font sizing could be relative to the grid size

But it fulfills its basic purpose as is.
